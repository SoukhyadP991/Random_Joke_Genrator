Random Joke Generator - How It Works

1. Overview:
    This app fetches random jokes from the Official Joke API and displays them to the user. It includes a casino roulette style animation when fetching a new joke, a light/dark theme toggle, and the ability to save favorite jokes using localStorage.

2. HTML Structure:
    - The main container holds the title, theme toggle switch, joke display area, control buttons, and favorites list.
    - The joke display area shows the setup and punchline of the current joke.
    - Buttons allow the user to get a new joke or save the current joke to favorites.
    - The favorites container lists all saved jokes.

3. CSS Styling:
- Playful and responsive styling is applied for a fun user experience.
- Light and dark themes are supported, toggled via a switch.
- Smooth transitions and fade-in effects enhance visual appeal.

4. JavaScript Functionality:

    a) DOM Elements:
        - Elements like buttons, joke display paragraphs, favorites container, and theme toggle are selected for manipulation.

    b) Fetching Jokes:
        - When the "Get Joke" button is clicked, a roulette animation starts cycling through placeholder jokes with Indian context.
        - After the animation completes (~1.2 seconds), a random joke is fetched asynchronously from the Official Joke API.
        - The fetched joke's setup and punchline are displayed with a fade-in effect.

    c) Roulette Animation:
        - Uses a timer to cycle through a predefined list of placeholder jokes rapidly.
        - Creates a casino roulette or slot machine effect before showing the actual joke.

    d) Saving Favorites:
        - The "Save Joke" button saves the current joke to an array stored in localStorage.
        - Duplicate jokes are prevented.
        - The favorites list is rendered dynamically below the buttons.
        - Favorites persist across page reloads.

    e) Theme Toggle:
        - The light/dark theme switch toggles a CSS class on the body element.
        - The user's theme preference is saved in localStorage and applied on page load.

5. Persistence:
    - localStorage is used to save favorite jokes and theme preference.
    - On page load, saved favorites and theme are loaded and applied.
